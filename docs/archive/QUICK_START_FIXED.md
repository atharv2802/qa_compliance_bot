# Quick Start - Everything Working

**Status:** ✅ ALL FIXED  
**Date:** October 23, 2025

---

## 🚀 Start Both Services

```powershell
# Terminal 1: Start API
cd D:\qa_compliance_bot
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
uvicorn app.api:app --reload

# Terminal 2: Start Streamlit  
cd D:\qa_compliance_bot
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
streamlit run app/dashboard.py
```

**URLs:**
- 🌐 Streamlit: http://localhost:8501
- 🔌 API: http://localhost:8000
- 📚 API Docs: http://localhost:8000/docs

## ✅ Test Dropdown Selection

1. Open http://localhost:8501
2. Click dropdown "Choose a pre-loaded example:"
3. Select any test case
4. **Expected:** Text areas populate immediately ✅

---

## ✅ Test Event Logging

1. Click "Get Suggestion" button
2. Wait for suggestion to appear
3. Click "✅ Use" button
4. **Expected:** Green message "✓ Event logged as accepted" ✅

---

## ✅ Test Reports

1. Go to "Reports" tab
2. **Expected:** See metrics and charts (while API is running!) ✅

---

## 📊 How It Works Now

```
Dropdown Selection:
  Select example → Session state updated → Text areas populate ✅

Event Logging:
  Click Use → HTTP POST to API → API writes to DB → Success message ✅

Reports:
  Open tab → HTTP GET from API → API reads DB → Display charts ✅
```

---

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

1. **Dropdown** - Now uses session state + st.rerun()
2. **Event Logging** - Only via API (no direct DB write)
3. **Reports** - Only via API (no direct DB read)
4. **Database** - API is sole accessor (no conflicts!)

---

## 📝 Key Files Changed

- `app/dashboard.py` - All fixes applied
- `app/api.py` - No changes needed (already had `/events/stats`)

---

## 🎉 Everything Should Work!

Both issues are now fixed:
✅ Dropdown populates text areas
✅ Events are logged via API
✅ Reports show data via API
✅ No database locking errors

**Test it now and let me know if there are any remaining issues!** 🚀
