# Dropdown Selection Fix - Final Implementation

**Date**: October 23, 2025  
**Issue**: Pre-loaded example dropdown not populating text areas  
**Solution**: Use `on_change` callback with direct widget key updates

---

## 🎯 What the Dropdown Does

The **"Choose a pre-loaded example"** dropdown allows you to:

1. **Quickly test compliance violations** without typing
2. **Demo different policy violations** (280+ real examples)
3. **Train with realistic scenarios**:
   - Guarantees (ADV-6.2)
   - PII/SSN disclosure (PII-SSN)
   - Tone violations (TONE)
   - Disclosure issues (DISC-1.1)
   - Clean compliant messages

---

## ✅ How It Works Now

### User Flow:

```
1. User opens Live Suggestions tab
   ↓
2. Clicks dropdown: "Choose a pre-loaded example:"
   ↓
3. Sees 280+ test cases:
   - (Select a test case)
   - ADV-6.2: We guarantee 12% returns...
   - PII-SSN: Your SSN 123-45-6789...
   - TONE: Don't be an idiot...
   - etc.
   ↓
4. Selects an example (e.g., "ADV-6.2: We guarantee...")
   ↓
5. ✨ IMMEDIATELY:
   - "Agent's draft message" fills with violation text
   - "Conversation context" fills with scenario
   ↓
6. User clicks "Get Suggestion"
   ↓
7. Sees compliant rewrite!
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### The Fix: `on_change` Callback

**File:** `app/dashboard.py` lines 189-234

**Key Changes:**

```python
# ✅ AFTER (Working):
def on_example_selected():
    """Callback triggered when dropdown changes."""
    selected = st.session_state.example_selector
    if selected != "(Select a test case)":
        idx = example_options.index(selected) - 1
        # Directly update widget states (not separate variables)
        st.session_state.agent_draft_input = examples[idx].get("agent_draft", "")
        st.session_state.context_input = examples[idx].get("context", "")

st.selectbox(
    "Choose a pre-loaded example:",
    example_options,
    key="example_selector",
    on_change=on_example_selected  # ← Triggers on selection
)

# Text areas use same keys that callback updates
st.text_area(..., key="agent_draft_input")  # ← Same key!
st.text_area(..., key="context_input")      # ← Same key!
```

**Why This Works:**
1. Streamlit widget keys are **the source of truth**
2. `on_change` callback runs **before** UI re-renders
3. Directly updating `st.session_state.agent_draft_input` updates the widget's value
4. No need for separate tracking variables or `st.rerun()`

## 📊 Example Data Structure

**File:** `data/synthetic/coach_cases.jsonl`

Each example has this structure:
```json
{
  "policy_id": "ADV-6.2",
  "severity": "critical",
  "agent_draft": "We guarantee 12% returns every year!",
  "context": "Customer asking about investment performance",
  "suggestion": "Past performance doesn't guarantee future results...",
  "policy_refs": ["ADV-6.2"],
  "latency_ms": 234
}
```

**280+ examples covering:**
- ✅ Critical violations (guarantees, PII)
- ✅ High severity (misleading statements)
- ✅ Medium severity (disclosure missing)
- ✅ Low severity (tone issues)
- ✅ Clean examples (fully compliant)

## 🧪 Testing the Dropdown

### Test 1: Select Example

1. Open http://localhost:8501
2. Go to "Live Suggestions" tab
3. Click dropdown "Choose a pre-loaded example:"
4. Select "ADV-6.2: We guarantee 12% returns..."
5. **Expected:**
   - ✅ "Agent's draft message" fills: "We guarantee 12% returns every year!"
   - ✅ "Conversation context" fills: "Customer asking about..."
6. Click "Get Suggestion"
7. **Expected:**
   - ✅ See compliant rewrite
   - ✅ Policy violation ADV-6.2 highlighted

### Test 2: Multiple Selections

1. Select "PII-SSN: Your SSN 123-45-6789..."
2. **Expected:** Text updates to PII example
3. Select "TONE: Don't be an idiot..."
4. **Expected:** Text updates to tone example
5. Each selection should work instantly ✅

### Test 3: Manual Edit After Selection

1. Select any example
2. Text populates ✅
3. Manually edit the text
4. **Expected:** Your edits are preserved
5. Click "Get Suggestion" with edited text
6. **Expected:** Suggestion based on your edited version ✅

## 💡 What Changed from Before

### ❌ Previous Approach (Didn't Work):

```python
# Tried to use value= parameter with separate state
st.session_state['agent_draft_text'] = examples[idx]["agent_draft"]
agent_draft = st.text_area(
    ...,
    value=st.session_state['agent_draft_text'],
    key="agent_draft_input"
)
# Problem: widget key and value were out of sync
```

### ✅ New Approach (Works):

```python
# Directly update the widget's key in callback
def on_example_selected():
    st.session_state.agent_draft_input = examples[idx]["agent_draft"]

st.text_area(..., key="agent_draft_input")
# Widget key is the single source of truth
```

---

## 🎯 Benefits

1. **Instant Response** - No lag, no manual refresh needed
2. **Simple State Management** - Widget keys are source of truth
3. **Reliable** - Streamlit's built-in state system handles it
4. **User-Friendly** - Works exactly as expected
5. **Test Coverage** - 280+ examples for comprehensive testing

## 📝 Common Use Cases

### For Testing:
- "Let me try different violation types"
- "I want to see how it handles PII"
- "Show me a tone violation example"

### For Demo:
- "Here's how the coach detects guarantees..."
- "Watch what happens with this SSN disclosure..."
- "See the difference between compliant and non-compliant..."

### For Training:
- "Learn what violations look like"
- "Practice identifying policy issues"
- "Understand compliant alternatives"
