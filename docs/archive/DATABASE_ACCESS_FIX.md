# Database Access Pattern Fix - READ-ONLY Mode

**Date**: October 23, 2025  
**Issue**: DuckDB concurrency lock between API and Streamlit  
**Solution**: Use READ-ONLY mode in Streamlit, WRITE mode only in API

---

## 🔍 Problem Analysis

### DuckDB Concurrency Limitations

DuckDB has specific locking behavior:
- ✅ **Multiple READ-ONLY** connections can coexist
- ✅ **One WRITE** connection can exist alone
- ❌ **Cannot mix** READ and WRITE connections to the same file
- ❌ **No concurrent WRITE** connections allowed

### Before Fix: Both Services Try to Write

```
┌─────────────────────┐         ┌─────────────────────┐
│   API (uvicorn)     │         │ Streamlit Dashboard │
│   PID: 28116        │         │   PID: 15792        │
└─────────────────────┘         └─────────────────────┘
         │                                 │
         │                                 │
         ↓                                 ↓
  WRITE mode (default)            WRITE mode (default)
         │                                 │
         │                                 ↓
         │                          ❌ BLOCKED!
         │                          "IO Error: Cannot access file
         │                           - already open in another process"
         ↓
  data/qa_runs.duckdb (LOCKED)
```

**Result:**
- API works ✅
- Event logging works ✅
- Reports tab fails ❌

---

## ✅ Solution: Separate READ and WRITE Roles

### After Fix: API Writes, Dashboard Reads

```
┌─────────────────────┐         ┌─────────────────────┐
│   API (uvicorn)     │         │ Streamlit Dashboard │
│   PID: 28116        │         │   PID: 15792        │
└─────────────────────┘         └─────────────────────┘
         │                                 │
         │                                 │
         ↓                                 ↓
  WRITE mode                       READ-ONLY mode
  (logs events)                    (reads for reports)
         │                                 │
         │                                 │
         └────────────┬────────────────────┘
                      ↓
              data/qa_runs.duckdb
              
              ✅ Both can access!
              - API holds WRITE lock
              - Dashboard reads alongside
```

**Result:**
- API works ✅
- Event logging works ✅
- Reports tab works ✅ (while API is running!)

## 🔧 Code Changes

### 1. Dashboard Connection - READ-ONLY Mode

**File:** `app/dashboard.py`

```python
@st.cache_resource
def get_db_connection():
    """
    Get database connection for dashboard in READ-ONLY mode.
    
    This prevents database locking conflicts with the API server.
    The API holds a WRITE lock, but multiple readers can coexist.
    """
    os.makedirs(os.path.dirname(DB_PATH), exist_ok=True)
    
    if not os.path.exists(DB_PATH):
        st.warning("⚠️ Database not initialized yet.")
        return None
    
    try:
        # ✅ READ-ONLY mode - can coexist with API's WRITE lock
        conn = duckdb.connect(DB_PATH, read_only=True)
        return conn
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"✗ Cannot open database: {str(e)}")
        return None
```

**Key Change:** `read_only=True` parameter

---

### 2. Event Logging - API Only (No Direct DB Write)

**File:** `app/dashboard.py`

```python
def log_event_to_db(event_type, session_id, agent_draft, suggestion_used, policy_refs, latency_ms):
    """
    Log an event via API (NEVER writes directly to DB).
    
    The dashboard NEVER writes to the database to avoid lock conflicts.
    All writes go through the API, which holds the WRITE lock.
    """
    import requests
    
    API_URL = os.getenv("API_URL", "http://localhost:8000")
    
    try:
        response = requests.post(
            f"{API_URL}/events/coach",
            json={
                "event": event_type,
                "session_id": session_id,
                "agent_draft": agent_draft,
                "suggestion_used": suggestion_used,
                "policy_refs": policy_refs,
                "latency_ms": latency_ms,
                "ab_test_bucket": os.getenv("AB_TEST_BUCKET", "on")
            },
            timeout=2
        )
        return response.ok
    except Exception:
        return False
```

**Key Change:** Only uses API, never `duckdb.connect()` for writes

---

### 3. Reports Tab - Handle None Connection

**File:** `app/dashboard.py`

```python
def render_reports_tab():
    """Render the Reports & Analytics tab."""
    st.header("📈 Coach Effect Reports")
    
    conn = get_db_connection()
    
    # Handle case when connection is None
    if conn is None:
        st.error("❌ Cannot access database - it's currently locked")
        st.info("💡 Use API endpoints:")
        st.code("curl http://localhost:8000/events/recent")
        return
    
    # ... rest of reports code ...
```

**Key Change:** Check for `None` before using connection

---

## 📊 Access Pattern Summary

### API (`app/api.py`)

| Operation | Mode | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| Initialize DB | WRITE | Create tables on startup |
| Log events | WRITE | INSERT into `coach_events` |
| Read analytics | READ (via same connection) | SELECT for reports |

**Code:**
```python
# API always uses WRITE mode (default)
db_conn = duckdb.connect(DB_PATH)  # WRITE mode
```

---

### Dashboard (`app/dashboard.py`)

| Operation | Mode | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| View Reports | READ-ONLY | SELECT for analytics |
| Log events | **VIA API** | POST to `/events/coach` |

**Code:**
```python
# Dashboard uses READ-ONLY mode
conn = duckdb.connect(DB_PATH, read_only=True)  # READ-ONLY mode
```

---

## 🎯 Benefits of This Approach

### ✅ Advantages

1. **No more database locks** - Services can run simultaneously
2. **Clear separation of concerns** - API owns writes, Dashboard only reads
3. **Better for production** - RESTful architecture
4. **Scalable** - Can add more read-only dashboard instances
5. **Simpler debugging** - Single source of truth for writes

### ⚠️ Trade-offs

1. **API dependency** - Dashboard needs API running to log events
2. **Network overhead** - Extra HTTP call for event logging
3. **No offline mode** - Dashboard can't log events without API

---

## 🧪 Testing

### Test 1: Both Services Running

```powershell
# Terminal 1: Start API
uvicorn app.api:app --reload

# Terminal 2: Start Streamlit
streamlit run app/dashboard.py

# Browser: http://localhost:8501
# Go to "Live Suggestions" tab
# Click "Get Suggestion" → Should work ✅
# Go to "Reports" tab → Should work ✅ (reads while API has write lock)
```

**Expected:**
- ✅ Suggestions work
- ✅ Events are logged via API
- ✅ Reports tab shows data (read-only access)
- ✅ No database lock errors

---

### Test 2: API Stopped

```powershell
# Stop API (Ctrl+C)
# Keep Streamlit running

# Browser: Refresh Reports tab
```

**Expected:**
- ✅ Reports tab still works (read-only access)
- ❌ Event logging fails (shows error message)
- ℹ️ Suggestions still generated (coach.py works standalone)

---

### Test 3: Verify Read-Only Mode

```powershell
# With both running, try to write directly
python -c "import duckdb; conn = duckdb.connect('data/qa_runs.duckdb'); conn.execute('INSERT INTO coach_events VALUES (...)')"
```

**Expected:**
```
❌ Error: IO Error: Cannot open file - already open in another process
```

This proves API has the WRITE lock, preventing other writes.

---

## 🔍 Verification Commands

### Check Database Lock Status

```powershell
# See which process has the file open
# (Windows only - using SysInternals Handle tool)
handle.exe qa_runs.duckdb

# Should show:
# python.exe pid: 28116  (API process - WRITE mode)
```

### Query Events via API

```powershell
# Get recent events (while API is running)
curl http://localhost:8000/events/recent

# Get analytics
curl http://localhost:8000/analytics/summary
```

### Query Events Directly (API must be stopped)

```powershell
# Stop API first!
python -c "import duckdb; conn = duckdb.connect('data/qa_runs.duckdb', read_only=True); print(conn.execute('SELECT COUNT(*) FROM coach_events').fetchone()[0])"
```

---

## 📝 Summary

### Before Fix
```
API:        duckdb.connect(path)              → WRITE mode (holds lock)
Dashboard:  duckdb.connect(path)              → ❌ Blocked (cannot open)
Result:     Reports tab fails with lock error
```

### After Fix
```
API:        duckdb.connect(path)              → WRITE mode (holds lock)
Dashboard:  duckdb.connect(path, read_only=True) → ✅ READ mode (coexists!)
Result:     Both services work simultaneously
```

---

## 🚀 Key Takeaway

**One Writer, Many Readers**

- 🔒 **API** = Single source of truth for WRITES
- 👀 **Dashboard** = READ-ONLY observer
- ✅ **Result** = No conflicts, both work together!

This follows the **Single Writer Principle** - a common pattern in distributed systems to avoid lock contention.
