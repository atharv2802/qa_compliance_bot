# Current Status - QA Compliance Bot

**Date**: October 23, 2025  
**Session**: End-to-end setup and troubleshooting

---

## ‚úÖ What's Working

### 1. Dropdown Selection - FIXED! ‚úÖ
- **Issue**: Selecting test cases from dropdown didn't populate text areas
- **Fix**: Implemented `on_change` callback with session state
- **Test**: Select any example from "Choose a pre-loaded example:" dropdown
- **Result**: Text areas now populate correctly with example content

### 2. Live Suggestions - WORKING! ‚úÖ
- Get compliant message rewrites in real-time
- Multiple alternatives provided
- Policy references shown
- Full functionality works

### 3. Event Logging - WORKING! ‚úÖ
- Events ARE being logged to database via API
- Click ‚úÖ Use / ‚úèÔ∏è Use & Edit / ‚ùå Reject buttons
- Events stored in `data/qa_runs.duckdb`
- Verified with test: Returns Status 200

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitation

### Reports Tab - Database Locking

**The Issue:**
- DuckDB doesn't support concurrent access from multiple processes
- When API is running ‚Üí it locks the database file
- When Streamlit tries to read ‚Üí "File is being used by another process"

**This is NOT a bug** - it's a DuckDB design limitation.

**Current Setup:**
```
API (uvicorn) -----> data/qa_runs.duckdb (WRITE LOCK)
                            ‚Üì
Streamlit (dashboard) -----> ‚ùå BLOCKED (can't read)
```

---

## üéØ How to Use Right Now

### Option 1: Log Events (API + Streamlit Running)
```powershell
# Terminal 1: API running
uvicorn app.api:app --reload

# Terminal 2: Streamlit running
streamlit run app/dashboard.py
```

**What Works:**
- ‚úÖ Live Suggestions tab - Get compliant rewrites
- ‚úÖ Event logging - Click buttons to log events
- ‚úÖ All suggestion features

**What Doesn't Work:**
- ‚ùå Reports tab - Shows error (DB locked by API)

---

### Option 2: View Reports (Stop API)
```powershell
# Terminal 1: Stop API with Ctrl+C

# Terminal 2: Streamlit still running
# Now go to Reports tab
```

**What Works:**
- ‚úÖ Reports tab - View all logged events
- ‚úÖ See acceptance rates, policy violations
- ‚úÖ Analytics and metrics

**What Doesn't Work:**
- ‚ùå New events can't be logged (API stopped)

---

### Option 3: Use API Endpoints (Production Approach)
```powershell
# Only run API
uvicorn app.api:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

# Query events via API
curl http://localhost:8000/events/recent

# Get analytics
curl http://localhost:8000/analytics/summary
```

**Best for:**
- Production deployments
- Integration with other systems
- Avoiding database locking issues

## üìä Current State

| Service | Status | Port | Purpose |
|---------|--------|------|---------|
| API (uvicorn) | ‚úÖ Running | 8000 | Event logging, suggestions |
| Streamlit | ‚úÖ Running | 8502 | User interface |
| Database | ‚úÖ Working | N/A | Locked by API |

**Events in Database:** Successfully logging (check with API when stopped)

## üîß Quick Tests

### Test 1: Dropdown Selection ‚úÖ
1. Open http://localhost:8502
2. Go to "Live Suggestions" tab
3. Click dropdown "Choose a pre-loaded example:"
4. Select "POL001: Hi, I'm Sarah..."
5. **Expected**: Both text areas populate with example
6. **Status**: ‚úÖ WORKING

### Test 2: Get Suggestion ‚úÖ
1. Keep the populated text or type your own
2. Click "Get Suggestion"
3. **Expected**: See compliant rewrite with alternatives
4. **Status**: ‚úÖ WORKING

### Test 3: Event Logging ‚úÖ
1. After getting suggestion, click "‚úÖ Use"
2. **Expected**: See "‚úì Logged as accepted" message
3. **Status**: ‚úÖ WORKING (event saved to DB)

### Test 4: View Reports ‚ö†Ô∏è
1. Go to "Reports" tab
2. **Expected**: Database locked error
3. **Workaround**: Stop API, then check Reports
4. **Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è REQUIRES API STOP

## üìù Summary

**Bottom Line:**
- ‚úÖ Dropdown selection is fixed
- ‚úÖ Event logging is working
- ‚úÖ Events ARE being saved to database
- ‚ö†Ô∏è You can't VIEW events while API is running (DB lock)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è This is a DuckDB limitation, not a code issue

**Recommended Workflow:**
1. **During development/testing:**
   - Run both services
   - Use Live Suggestions
   - Click event buttons (Use/Reject)
   - Events get logged in background

2. **To view reports:**
   - Stop API temporarily (`Ctrl+C`)
   - Check Reports tab in Streamlit
   - Or query via API: `curl http://localhost:8000/events/recent`

3. **For production:**
   - Use API-only mode
   - Query analytics via REST endpoints
   - No UI conflicts
