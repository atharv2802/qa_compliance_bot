# Before & After Comparison

## System Evolution: V2 → V3_Enhanced

### Example 1: Guarantee Returns

**INPUT:** "We guarantee 12% returns on all investments"

**V2 Response:**
```
"Historical data shows an average of 12% annual returns over the past decade, 
but it's essential to understand that past performance isn't indicative of 
future results. Market conditions, economic factors, and timing can all 
significantly impact actual returns, which may be higher or lower than 
historical averages. Investments may lose value."
```
- ✅ Detailed and educational
- ✅ Confidence: 0.85

**V3_Enhanced Response:**
```
"While we understand you're looking for competitive returns, our investment 
strategies aim to achieve around 12%, but actual results depend on market 
conditions, economic factors, and timing. Investments may lose value."
```
- ✅ Detailed and educational
- ✅ Confidence: 0.95
- 🆕 Higher confidence (better calibration)

**Winner:** Tie (both excellent, v3_enhanced slightly more confident)

### Example 2: PII/SSN Handling

**INPUT:** "Your SSN 123-45-6789 is verified"

**V2 Behavior:**
1. Detect PII → BLOCK immediately
2. Return hardcoded template: "I've verified your information successfully."
3. No LLM involved

**V3_Enhanced Behavior:**
1. Detect PII → REDACT to `[SSN_REDACTED_1]`
2. Send redacted version to LLM with placeholder guidance
3. LLM generates: "I've successfully verified your identity and can now assist you with your account. What would you like to help with today?"
4. Validate no PII leaked

**Winner:** 🏆 **V3_Enhanced** (LLM-generated, not hardcoded)

---

### Example 3: SEC-1.0 Violation (NEW!)

**INPUT:** "Can you provide your SSN so I can verify your account?"

**V2 Response:**
- ❌ No SEC-1.0 policy (didn't exist)
- Treats as PII-SSN only
- Returns: "I've verified your information successfully."

**V3_Enhanced Response:**
- ✅ Detects SEC-1.0 violation
- Policy Refs: `["SEC-1.0"]`
- Suggests: "For verification, please access your account through our mobile app or secure portal. I can guide you through the process if needed."
- Redirects to secure channel

**Winner:** 🏆 **V3_Enhanced** (new policy coverage)

---

### Example 4: Tone Violation

**INPUT:** "Are you stupid? Obviously read the terms!"

**V2 Response:**
```
"I appreciate you reaching out about your concerns. Let me explain our fee 
structure in more detail and see how I can help you understand your account 
better."
```
- ✅ Empathetic
- ✅ Helpful
- ✅ Confidence: 0.90

**V3_Enhanced Response:**
```
"I completely understand your concern about fees. Our terms can be quite 
detailed, so let me point you to the specific section that addresses your 
question about fees and break it down for you in plain language."
```
- ✅ Empathetic
- ✅ Helpful
- ✅ More specific to context (fees)
- ✅ Confidence: 0.90

**Winner:** 🏆 **V3_Enhanced** (more contextual)
