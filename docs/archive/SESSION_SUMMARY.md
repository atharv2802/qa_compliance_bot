# Session Summary - All Fixes Applied

**Date**: October 23, 2025  
**Session**: Complete troubleshooting and enhancement

---

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. Database Concurrency Lock ✅

**Problem:**
- DuckDB doesn't support concurrent read + write access
- API held WRITE lock, Dashboard couldn't access database
- Reports tab failed with "file is being used by another process"

**Solution:**
- Dashboard now uses API endpoints exclusively (no direct DB access)
- API is the single writer
- Reports tab gets data via HTTP GET requests

**Files Changed:**
- `app/dashboard.py`: Removed direct DB access, added API calls
- `app/api.py`: Already had `/events/stats` endpoint

---

### 2. Event Logging Not Working ✅

**Problem:**
- Events appeared not to be logged
- Actually they WERE logged, but couldn't be viewed (DB locked)

**Solution:**
- Dashboard logs events via API POST to `/events/coach`
- Dashboard shows clear success/failure messages
- Reports tab displays logged events via API

**Files Changed:**
- `app/dashboard.py`: Event logging with visual feedback
- Shows "✓ Event logged as accepted" or "✗ Event NOT logged"

---

### 3. Dropdown Selection Not Working ✅

**Problem:**
- Selecting example from dropdown didn't populate text areas
- Session state and widget keys were out of sync

**Solution:**
- Use `on_change` callback with direct widget key updates
- Streamlit widget keys are now single source of truth
- Instant population on selection

**Files Changed:**
- `app/dashboard.py` lines 189-234: New dropdown implementation

---

### 4. Analytics Endpoints Missing ✅

**Problem:**
- Avg Latency showed "N/A"
- Policy Violations chart showed placeholder message

**Solution:**
- Added `/analytics/latency` endpoint
- Added `/analytics/policies` endpoint
- Reports tab now shows complete analytics

**Files Changed:**
- `app/api.py`: Added 2 new endpoints (lines 321-428)
- `app/dashboard.py`: Integrated new endpoints in Reports tab

Streamlit Dashboard (Port 8501)
    ├─ Live Suggestions Tab
    │   ├─ Dropdown → Populates text areas ✅
    │   ├─ Get Suggestion → Calls coach.py ✅
    │   └─ Click ✅ Use → HTTP POST to API ✅
    │
    └─ Reports Tab
        ├─ GET /events/stats → Metrics ✅
        ├─ GET /analytics/latency → Latency stats ✅
        └─ GET /analytics/policies → Policy violations ✅
                    ↓
            FastAPI (Port 8000)
                ├─ POST /events/coach (write events)
                ├─ GET /events/stats (read aggregations)
                ├─ GET /analytics/latency (latency metrics)
                └─ GET /analytics/policies (policy violations)
                            ↓
                    DuckDB (WRITE mode)
                    🔒 Locked by API only
```

   - Open http://localhost:8501
   - Select example from dropdown
   - ✅ Text areas populate instantly

2. **Live Suggestions**
   - Click "Get Suggestion"
   - ✅ See compliant rewrite
   - ✅ See policy violations highlighted

3. **Event Logging**
   - Click "✅ Use" button
   - ✅ See green "✓ Event logged as accepted"

4. **Reports Tab**
   - Go to "Reports" tab
   - ✅ See Total Events, Accept Rate
   - ✅ See Avg Latency (not "N/A")
   - ✅ See "Events by Type" chart
   - ✅ See "Violations by Policy" chart

   - `/analytics/export` - CSV export

2. **UI Improvements:**
   - Add "Clear" button to reset form
   - Add "Copy suggestion" button
   - Add dark mode toggle

3. **Advanced Features:**
   - A/B test comparison charts
   - Real-time event streaming
   - Custom date range filters
